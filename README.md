# Trench-Marine-Doom

Trench Marine Doom is an improved (or rather edited) wad of Marine1.wad by Sergeant Daniel G. Snyder and World War Doom by MegaZombieman115. Both maps have been compiled into a single wad and is heavily modified and showcases what open battlefields would look like in Doom using only vanilla stock monsters (with a bit of Dehacked tinkering).

A Doom wad that utilizes limit-removing modifications using only simple Dehacked gimmicks and Eternity's advanced bits 2 &amp; 3. This is an edited map of Marine1.wad by Sergeant Daniel G. Snyder, USMC, and MegaZombieman115.
